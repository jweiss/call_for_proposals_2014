# Monitoring Large-Scale Applications

Monitoring is hard. Monitoring large and distributed applications is unfortunately harder. This talk will walk you through some patterns that can help. We will look at recommendations of things to monitor and alarm on and what metrics are meaningless. How applications can not only emit but also consume metrics and act on them. How to make sure your metrics are not just telling you the obvious when it is too late but instead pro-actively alarm you. We might need to refresh our statistics basics along the way.
